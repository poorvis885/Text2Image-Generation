**AI-Powered Image Generation using Stable Diffusion**

🚀 **Introduction**

This project implements an AI-powered image generation system using Stable Diffusion. It allows users to generate high-quality images from text prompts, leveraging the power of deep learning and Hugging Face's diffusion models.

✨ **Features**

- Text-to-image generation with Stable Diffusion
- Supports fine-tuning of model parameters for better results
- Optimized for both CPU and GPU inference
- Adjustable image resolution and size
- Easy integration with notebooks and web applications

🛠 **Installation & Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

### **Steps**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Authenticate with Hugging Face**:
   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```
4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python generate_image.py --prompt "A futuristic city skyline at sunset"
   ```

📌 **Usage**

- Modify the `generate_image.py` script to customize the prompt and settings.
- Adjust image size and resolution parameters.
- Save or display generated images directly from the script.

📦 **Requirements**

- `torch`
- `diffusers`
- `transformers`
- `accelerate`
- `PIL`
- `IPython`

**Install all dependencies with:**
```bash
pip install torch diffusers transformers accelerate pillow ipython
```

📊 **Results & Output**

After running the script, the generated images will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.
