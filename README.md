**AI-Powered Image Generation using Stable Diffusion**


🚀 **Introduction**

This project implements an AI-powered image generation system using Stable Diffusion. It allows users to generate high-quality images from text prompts, leveraging the power of deep learning and Hugging Face's diffusion models.

✨ **Features**

Text-to-image generation with Stable Diffusion

Supports fine-tuning of model parameters for better results

Optimized for both CPU and GPU inference

Adjustable image resolution and size

Easy integration with notebooks and web applications

🛠 **Installation & Setup**

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.8+

Git

Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

Steps

**Clone the repository**:
